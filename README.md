# Storm's C++ Utilities
Just useful utilities that I've made and remade over time.

## Project contents

### Containers
Over time I've found some opinionated containers are useful to have
available. Multi-producer multi-consumer queues that block the consumers
are nice for efficient queueing of work items between threads, and those are
in `mpmc_queue.hpp`.

## About this project

### C++ Version Support
C++11 as an absolute baseline, higher when convenient.

### Build system
**TODO: build system docs**

### Tests
**TODO: how are we doing tests?**

### Licensing
AGPLv3 (only) by default. If that's an issue, ask me about working out
something else.
